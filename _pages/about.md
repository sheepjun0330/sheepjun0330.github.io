About Me
======

I am a second-year M.S./Ph.D. student in the **Graduate School of AI at POSTECH**, where I am a member of the Machine Learning Lab and fortunate to be advised by **Sangdon Park**. My current research interests largely lie in the safe and trustworthy deployment of large language models.

My research focuses on **machine learning and trustworthy AI**, with particular interests in selective generation, conformal prediction, prompt learning, and large language models.

While pursuing an M.S. in Industrial and Management Engineering at POSTECH advised by Minwoo Chae, I worked on a number of statistical data analysis projects in the industry domain, applying Bayesian and computational statistics methodologies. Prior to joining POSTECH, I also worked as a student researcher in the Design Informatics Lab at Hanyang University, where I developed a computational interaction algorithm that assists users in efficiently searching the design space, generalizing the concept of Bayesian information gain. I earned a B.E. in Statistics at Korea University.
