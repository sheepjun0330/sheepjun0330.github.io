About Me
======

I am a second-year M.S./Ph.D. student in the **Graduate School of AI at POSTECH**, where I am a member of the Machine Learning Lab and fortunate to be advised by **Sangdon Park**. 

My research interests lie in **trustworthy AI and machine unlearning**, exploring how to make AI systems more reliable, interpretable, and controllable. I am particularly interested in conformal prediction, selective generation, and prompt learning techniques for building trustworthy language models.
